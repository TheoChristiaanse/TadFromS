# TadFromS
Understand how the adiabatic temperature curves change with changing first order magnetocaloric material data properties.

# Introduction
These are files that creates and interactive app in jupyter notebook so a student can play with the specific heat of a hypothetical magnetocaloric material and understand how the adiabatic temperature curves change. The model is based around a mathematical description found in a REF 1. 

This repository has been optimized to work using binder.org which allows people without python installed to run this code:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TheoChristiaanse/TadFromS/master?filepath=Sliders%20Hyst%20App.ipynb

This app is based around a series of open source python apps created to understand the functioning of the AMR and magnetocaloric materials. Other apps include a 1D numerical model and a Preisach model.
